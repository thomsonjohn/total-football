# Total Football

A web app I built to get some practice with React, fetching and displaying data from an API and to use for keeping up with football scores.

Run `yarn` to install dependencies.

Launch with `yarn start`.

##### Plans for future

1. Use [Redux](https://redux.js.org/introduction) to manage state
2. Routing with [Router5](https://router5.js.org/)
3. Styling with [Fela](http://fela.js.org/)

##### API

Data comes from [football-data.org](https://www.football-data.org/)
